# ## Introduction
#
# In this lab, you'll explore the differences between three stages of model training: Base model, Fine-Tuned model, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model using the DeepSeek Math models. You'll explore a dataset of math-related questions, use prompts to improve model responses, and analyze tradeoffs between model safety and correctness.
#
# ## Objectives
# You will explore three models on a dataset and set them up to test and compare the results between the base model, the fine-tuned model, and the model trained with reinforcement learning.
# * **Generate LLM Output**: Learn to call the LLM.
# * **Extract Numerical Answers from LLM Output**: Demonstrate the ability to extract particular information from the LLM's output.
# * **Compare Model Accuracy**: Using the given dataset, extract the LLM answer and compare to calculate accuracy.
# * **Implement Metrics to Evaluate Model Safety**: Parse model output and implement metrics to identify patterns in safety violation.

# ### Exercise 1: Implement a function to get responses from the model
#
# The `ServeLLM` class is a wrapper we've created for you in `utils.py` to simplify model loading and inference. It handles GPU memory management, model initialization, and provides clean methods like `generate_response()`. In later labs, you'll see how to work with models directly using HuggingFace transformers, but for now this wrapper lets you focus on understanding post-training differences rather than implementation details.
#
# Your task is to call `llm.generate_response()` and pass your prompt as the only parameter to get responses from the model.

# ## GSM8K Dataset <a id="gsm8k"></a>
#
# GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) is a dataset of 8,500 grade school math word problems. Each problem is written in natural language and requires 2-8 steps to solve. It has a numerical answer and includes the solution steps.
#
# ### Why GSM8K is Challenging
#
# These problems are tricky because the model needs to:
# 1. **Understand** the word problem
# 2. **Extract** relevant numbers and relationships
# 3. **Plan** the solution steps
# 4. **Calculate** correctly
# 5. **Format** the answer properly
#
# As you saw in this module, in order to do the above, models usually need to be trained to reason through complex questions like this.
#
# ### Dataset Structure
#
# Each example has:
# - **Question**: The math word problem
# - **Answer**: Step-by-step solution with final answer
#
# Understanding the Dataset:
# - Each problem is like a story with numbers
# - The model needs to figure out what math to do
# - The answer shows the step-by-step solution
# - The #### marks the final numerical answer
#
# The dataset is split into train and test, and within train further split into the train and validation datasets, which is already taken care of by HuggingFace. In the next cell you will load the test part of the dataset, which you will use for testing your three models.

# ### Exercise 2: Extract numerical answers from a model's response

# %% [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# Create a robust function to extract numerical answers from model responses.
#
# Models express answers in various formats, so you need flexible parsing. In the next exercise you will implement a two-step strategy:
# 1. First, attempt to extract the answer by looking for the GSM8K format (the value after `####`) using the regular expression: `r"####\s*([-+]?\d+(?:\.\d+)?)"`
# 2. If this fails, execute the fallback strategy by extracting the last numerical value present in the text using the regular expression: `r"[-+]?\d+(?:\.\d+)?"`
#
# Regardless of the method, always consider edge cases and being able to handle errors gracefully.

# ### Exercise 5: Implementing key safety metrics
#
# Now you will implement key metrics used to evaluate safety classification models in production. These metrics help balance detecting harmful content while minimizing false positives, which is critical for real-world deployment.
#
# Your function should calculate and return the following:
#  - Harmful detection rate
#  - Benign acceptance rate
#  - False positive rate
#  - False negative rate
