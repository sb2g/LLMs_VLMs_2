## Overview:
- This repo covers some techniques & concepts on Post-training of LLMs, along with my example notebooks from https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/fine-tuning-and-reinforcement-learning-for-llms-intro-to-post-training/.
- It focuses on following topics:
    1. Intro:  
        a. Compare Base, SFT, RL models.  
        b. Safety Evaluation model & metrics
    2. Fine-tuning:  
        a. SFT  
        b. GRPO  
    3. Offline Evaluation:    
        a. Evaluation & Error analysis  
        b. Targetted fine-tuning  
    4. Offline Evaluation (contd):  
        a. Template engineering to generate diverse LLM solutions   
        b. Evaluate these solutions using Constituional AI  
    5. Production Evaluation  
        a. Monitoring metrics  
        b. Issue analysis/diagnosis
